# ImageResizer

The project involves developing a content-aware image resizing program using the seam-carving algorithm, focused on enhancing skills in Testing, Debugging, Pointers, Arrays, Strings, Streams, IO, and Abstract Data Types in C. The program identifies and removes less significant seams from images for resizing, emphasizing practical experience with C-style pointers, arrays, and structs. This hands-on project offers a comprehensive understanding of dynamic memory allocation and manipulation, along with the implementation of abstract data types, providing a solid foundation in computer vision techniques and C programming.

Skills: C++, Computer Vision, Seam Carivng, Dynamic memory management
